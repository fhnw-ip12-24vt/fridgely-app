#Product Descriptions
product.bio.local.lowCO2=Organic products are good for the environment because they are produced without harmful chemicals and exploitative farming methods! In addition, this product has a short transport route! Very good!
product.bio.local.highCO2=Local organic products are great for the environment, but a lot of CO2 is emitted during the cultivation of this special product.
product.bio.foreign.lowCO2=Organic products are good for the environment because they are produced without harmful chemicals and exploitative farming methods! Unfortunately, this product comes from far away, and the transport is very harmful to the environment
product.bio.foreign.highCO2=Organic products are good for the environment, but they come from far away and also have a high CO2 footprint in cultivation. Look for local alternatives!
product.non_bio.local.lowCO2=Little is known about the cultivation methods used for this purpose. This could mean that harmful pesticides or fertilizers pollute the environment during cultivation. Nevertheless, the short transport route is very good for keeping the CO2 footprint small!
product.non_bio.local.highCO2=Little is known about the cultivation methods used for this purpose. This could mean that harmful pesticides or fertilizers pollute the environment during cultivation. In addition, the product is known to be quite harmful to the environment in cultivation.
product.non_bio.foreign.lowCO2=Little information on cultivation and long transport routes make this product a poor choice for the sake of the environment.
product.non_bio.foreign.highCO2=Little information on cultivation and long transport routes make this product a poor choice for the sake of the environment. It is known to produce a lot of CO2 even during cultivation itself!
