# Product Descriptions
product.bio.local.highCO2=Local organic products are great for the environment, but a lot of CO2 is emitted during the cultivation of this particular product.
product.non_bio.foreign.lowCO2=Limited information on cultivation and long transport routes make this product a poor environmental choice.
# Meat
product.bio.foreign.meat=Producing meat is generally more resource-intensive than plant-based foods. Although this is organically farmed, the long transport route significantly harms the environment.
# Coffee Belt
product.bio.foreign.coffee_belt=Certain foods can only grow near the equator, so they inevitably travel long distances to reach here.
# Water Intensive
product.non_bio.local.water_intensive=Foods like this require a lot of water to grow profitably. This often depletes rivers and groundwater of their natural reserves.
